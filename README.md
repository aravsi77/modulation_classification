# modulation_classification
this neural network model is try to classify the modulation and snr from the received signal data.
this model uses simple neural network model with only one hidden layer. There are only 64 activation unit that use tanh activation function. 
the output layer uses sigmoid activation function to classify between two classes BPSK and GFSK
