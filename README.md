# modulation_classification 
# Tensorflow and Keras

this is another improvement to the modulation classifier algorithm. 
this model use programming framework Tensorflow and Keras
this neural network model is try to classify the modulation and snr from the received signal data.
the output layer uses sigmoid activation function to classify between two classes BPSK and GFSK
