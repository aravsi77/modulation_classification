# modulation_classification

this is another improvement to the modulation classifier algorithm. 
this model use Deep Learning implementation instead of only one hidden layer
this neural network model is try to classify the modulation and snr from the received signal data.
the output layer uses sigmoid activation function to classify between two classes BPSK and GFSK
